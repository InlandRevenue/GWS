# Payday filing through Gateway Services

Payday filing lets employers:
* file employment information
* provide details for new and departing employees.

There is currently no gateway method for employer deductions payment.

## Employment information

Employment information includes employee's income and deduction information for each pay cycle. 
If businesses use payroll software they must submit this to us within two working days of the payday.

## Employee details

Employers will also need to submit through their software additional details for new and departing employees. This must be before the next employment information due date.
The employment information application programming interface (API) lets employers send us this information each pay cycle.
